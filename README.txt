This program is called Subtract_Adverb, and it functions by checking for adverbs in your short story and telling you which ones are there, so you can find them and replace them. First, click on the below link, which will open this code in a remote server using a free service called Binder. This may take a few minutes.  When it loads, open your_story.txt and paste your story into the file. Then, save and close it. Then, open a new terminal by clicking New > Terminal. A command prompt will open in a new tab. Into it, paste the following command:

python subtract_adverb.py

Then, it will print out a list of the adverbs in your story, and you can go fix it so Dierdre doesn't yell at you like she always yells at me. See? I even used an adverb in that sentence. God I need this program. Anyway, if you think that the program got a word wrong, or missed something, feel free to contact me through Blackboard, or at mscott66@jh.edu.
